# CS347
Compilers lab, Jan'16 - Apr'16

There were total 4 assignemnts in this lab. 

#Assignment 1
Designed a simple grammer with the following features:

	(i)		assignments, id := expr
	
	(ii)	condistions, if expr then expr2
	
	(iii)	loop, while expr do stmt
	
	(iv)	compound statement, begin opt_stmts end
	
	(v)		Arithmetic and relational operator.
	
And developed a simple compiler that generates x85 code.


#Assignment 2

Part(a)	Write a C code to convert a regular expression into minimised DFA.

Part(b) Write a Grammer for the compiler and do its lexical analysis.

#Assignment 3
Perform changes in the grammer if needed.
Perform Parsing of the grammer developed in Assignment 2.

#Assigment 4

Build Complete Compiler for the grammer previously decided. 
Perform Syntax, semantic analysis and Did Code generation (to x86).

Code Refactoring is Required.
